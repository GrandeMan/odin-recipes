    <h4>Pizza recipe modifiers</h4>
    <p>Pizza is one of the easiest and tastiest dishes you can make. Having said that,
        not all pizzas are created equally. If you want to improve your pizza-making ability
        and are up for a challenge, then consider swapping the readymade ingredients for handmade ones.
        This version of the pizza takes more time to make but you'll definitely taste the difference!
