    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <em>I know there are hardcore Italian pizza eaters out there who vow to never eat a Hawaiian pizza. 
            And although sweet, juicy pineapple and ham may not be traditional pizza, just one time, step 
            outside the box and see what you're missing. It's good, really good, and quick and easy!</em></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
                <li>6 strips turkey bacon or lean deli ham slices</li>
                <li>1 cup Pizza Sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>half cup shredded cheddar cheese or quarter cup grated parmesan </li>
                <li>1 (20 ounce) can Del Monte Pineapple Chunks in 100% Juice, well drained</li>
                <li>half cup thinly sliced green or red bell pepper strips</li>
                <li>quarter cup sliced green onion or diced red onion</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. 
                    Press dough into a 15x10-inch rectangle, and decoratively pinch the edges, if desired. 
                    Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges begin to turn light golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon or deli ham until crisp in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; crumble and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over crust. Sprinkle with cheese and remaining toppings. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until 
                        cheese is melted and crust is golden brown. </li>                 
            </ol>
